# DS4 API surface matrix

Status: Rust host `v0.1.0-rc.3`. The original route oracle came from the
v0.5.6/v0.6.0 API-promotion arc; this document records what each HTTP
generation surface supports today, which serving lane executes it, and the
known gaps.

The wire contracts below are model-family neutral in `ds4-dfm-rs`. DeepSeek
uses the Entrpi continuous graph, while Solar Open2, K-EXAONE, Motif-3, and
Qwen provide family-native persistent state where supported.
Tokenizer, prompt/tool syntax, and stop-token handling are dispatched by the
loaded model family without changing the endpoint schemas.

DS4 serves four wire surfaces. "Surface" means a distinct wire contract
(object types, stream events, ID scheme, finish mapping, error envelope),
not an API vendor. OpenAI Chat and legacy Completions are different
surfaces: they share an endpoint family but stream different objects.

| Surface | Endpoint | Buffered object | Stream objects |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI Chat | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | `chat.completion` | `chat.completion.chunk` deltas, `[DONE]` |
| OpenAI Completion | `POST /v1/completions` | `text_completion` | `text_completion` chunks with `choices[].text`, `[DONE]` |
| Anthropic Messages | `POST /v1/messages` | `type:"message"` | `message_start` .. `content_block_*` .. `message_delta`, `message_stop` |
| OpenAI Responses | `POST /v1/responses` | `object:"response"` | `response.created` .. item/delta events with `sequence_number`, `response.completed` |

## Serving lanes and current routing

Three lanes serve generation requests:

- **serial** (`generate_job`): one request at a time on the session graph.
  Full feature set, including live tool continuation and corrective tool
  recovery.
- **continuous** (`generate_continuous_jobs`): the batched engine with
  per-row sampling, streaming, stops, and tools. The Rust scheduler operates
  over the configured/native-fitted N-bank width, including width one, and
  refills idle rows from the live queue during an epoch.
- **static** (`generate_batch_jobs`): coalesced buffered greedy batches.

Routing since Inc 2 is the single pure decision function `route_decide`
over the request's computed needs word; as of Inc 6 the table is:

| Surface | serial | continuous | static |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI Chat | fallback | yes (prompt fits one bank) | buffered + greedy + non-thinking + no stops/tools |
| OpenAI Completion | fallback | yes (no tools/echo) | same conditions as Chat |
| Anthropic Messages | buffered tools, prefill-only zero, serial-owned live frontiers, fallback | yes — incl. STREAMING tools (Inc 6a) and bank-owned output-only continuations (Inc 6b) | needs-free buffered (Inc 3d) |
| OpenAI Responses | buffered tools, live reasoning state, serial-owned live frontiers, fallback | same as Anthropic | needs-free buffered (Inc 3d) |

Buffered tool generation deliberately keeps the serial lane: its
model-visible corrective retry has no row-local batched equivalent (plan §5
Inc 6 allows keeping it serial; the scoping comment sits at
`request_compute_needs`). Streaming tool turns publish BANK-owned
continuation records at the cont finalize; their output-only follow-ups
claim the bank back under generation/frontier equality
(`cont_bank_continuation_admit`), and victim placement never destroys a
bank inside its record's grace/pin window (Inc 6c). Kill switches, kept
one release: `DS4_SERVER_CONT_ANTHROPIC` / `DS4_SERVER_CONT_RESPONSES`
(stateless promotion, Inc 3) and `DS4_SERVER_CONT_TOOLS_ANTHROPIC` /
`DS4_SERVER_CONT_TOOLS_RESPONSES` (tool promotion, Inc 6 — effective only
while the surface's stateless switch is on).

Within OpenAI, still serial: non-streaming `return_token_ids` chat,
completion-kind requests with `return_token_ids`, and completion-kind
requests carrying tools.

## Output-budget (`max_tokens`) semantics today

All four parsers accept any integer without range validation (per-surface
range enforcement is Inc 2 work, after endpoint-native errors exist).
Since Inc 0b, every lane interprets the budget through one helper
(`request_decode_budget`) with three states:

- **omitted** — the server default (`--tokens`, default 393216);
- **explicit `<= 0`** — zero decode tokens (prefill-only): the serial
  lane's long-standing semantics and Anthropic's documented
  cache-prewarm contract (`stop_reason: "max_tokens"`, empty content);
- **positive** — the requested budget.

Residual, documented: the batched engine floors `max_new` at 1 (it
cannot retire an admission without sampling a seed token), so an
explicit zero that reaches a batched lane decodes exactly one token
instead of the pre-0b behavior of substituting the full server default.
No supported surface routes zero-budget work to a batched lane today
(Anthropic is serial by the API gate); true zero-decode stays a serial
capability until prefill-only routing lands (plan Inc 3).

The Anthropic parser requires `messages` but does not require
`max_tokens` (upstream requires it); an omitted value gets the server
default like every other surface.

## Trust domain (Inc 5)

The server is ONE trust domain. The continuation registry (one record per
Anthropic/Responses tool-call turn, keyed `(protocol, call_id)`) and exact-DSML
tool memory are global — there is no tenant or auth namespace, so the
`trust_namespace` component of the plan's registry key is a constant.
Knowledge of a tool-call ID is knowledge of the conversation: an output-only
continuation for that ID resumes the owning engine state — a batch BANK as
of Inc 6, not just the serial session — and a queued continuation's
grace/pin windows can shed other clients' serial work or hold batch victim
placement (bounded at the grace/pin deadline). IDs are
minted unguessable but travel in responses. Deployments serving mutually
untrusted tenants need an authenticating proxy or one server per tenant until
an authenticated namespace lands (documented restriction; also in
`crates/ds4-server/src/cont.rs` and the README compatibility boundary).

## Explicitly unsupported

- **Schema-constrained output** (v0.6.3): `response_format` with type
  `json_object`/`json_schema` (OpenAI Chat and Completion),
  `text.format` (Responses), and `output_format` / `output_config.format`
  (Anthropic) are refused at parse time with HTTP 400 and a typed
  message naming the mode, in the endpoint's native envelope
  (ds4-on-spark#10). `{"type":"text"}`, `null`, omitted, and a typeless
  object are accepted unchanged; the string spelling of a schema mode
  is refused too. Decode is never schema-constrained.
- **Responses durable references**: non-null `previous_response_id` or
  `conversation` values are rejected at parse time with
  "not supported; replay full input instead". DS4 serves a stateless
  Responses subset; clients replay full history. Literal `null` is
  accepted and ignored.
- **`Idempotency-Key`**: the HTTP reader parses only `Content-Length`,
  `Transfer-Encoding` (chunked request bodies, v0.6.3;
  `DS4_SERVER_CHUNKED=0` restores the Content-Length-only reader), and
  `Accept`; the header is accepted and discarded, so a retry is a new
  generation with new IDs.
- **`/v1/batch`** is a bulk scheduling consumer, not a projection surface.
- **`return_token_ids`** is an OpenAI Chat extension only.

## Known defects recorded as fixtures (fixed in later increments)

1. **FIXED (Inc 0b): continuous legacy-Completion streaming emitted chat
   deltas.** `cont_on_token` projected every streaming row through the
   chat delta machine, so a `text_completion` client received
   `chat.completion.chunk` objects. Completion rows now stream the
   serial oracle's plain `text_completion` chunks
   (`cont_stream_emit_plain`); the Inc 0a negative fixture is inverted
   (`test_cont_completion_stream_matches_serial_oracle`) and
   `speed-bench/completion_stream_gate.sh` holds the live schema +
   cont-engagement line.
2. **FIXED (Rust host RC.3): engine failures after SSE starts now terminate
   with the surface-native error event.** Responses preserve their live
   `sequence_number`, Anthropic emits `event: error` with its error envelope,
   and OpenAI streams emit an error object instead of a misleading `length`
   finish.
3. **FIXED (Inc 2b): error envelopes are endpoint-native.** Anthropic
   buffered errors carry the documented `{"type":"error","error":{...}}`
   envelope with a status-mapped type (400/409 `invalid_request_error`,
   404 `not_found_error`, 429 `rate_limit_error`, 500 `api_error`,
   503 `overloaded_error` — retryable in the native SDKs); Responses
   stream errors are protocol `data:` events (`{"type":"error",...}`)
   whose spliced `sequence_number` continues a live machine's counter.
   OpenAI chat/completions and Responses buffered errors keep the OpenAI
   envelope — it is the native family shape there. The flip happened
   inside `wire_http_error`/`wire_stream_error` (Inc 1c made the surface
   explicit at every call site, including the two 409 continuation-state
   refusals). Negative decode budgets now reject at parse with the
   client's own field name (`max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens` /
   `max_output_tokens`); explicit ZERO stays supported on every surface
   (Inc 0b route-invariant prefill-only, the Anthropic prewarm contract).
4. **FIXED (Inc 0b): admission accounting dropped decode-growth
   commitments** once a bank's prefill landed (the old `outstanding`
   charge covered pending prompt targets only). Every continuous
   admission now holds a lifetime credit — its full normalized target
   `min(prompt + decode budget, seq_cap)` — from install until the row
   ends, and both admission verdicts (comp-cache budget and live
   memory floor) charge the page UNION of all live credits plus the
   candidate. The union matters: per-layer bank strides are narrower
   than VMM pages are wide, so neighbor banks share edge pages and the
   true union of k full banks is far below `k x virtual/bank` — summing
   per-bank rounded projections would silently shrink live width. The
   verdict total (resident + projected credits) is timing-independent:
   the promise holds no matter how much of a row's growth has faulted
   in. Gate: `speed-bench/admission_credit_gate.sh` (achieved width at
   the default budget, pinned-budget hard-promise reject with serial
   fallback, credit release on row death and on mid-prefill abort).
5. **FIXED (Inc 0b): the v0.5.5 budget-cut honesty fix (#13) was
   serial-only.** On the continuous lane — where chat+tools actually
   routes — an unrepairable `max_tokens` cut inside a tool call
   reported `finish="error"` (and a repairable one still silently
   completes to `tool_calls`, matching serial's repair tier). The cont
   lane now mirrors serial: the finish stays the honest `length`, the
   partial call returns as assistant content, and the same
   "tool call cut by token budget" marker is logged — so
   `finish_reason_gate.sh`'s engagement oracle finally fires on the
   lane it actually exercises. Found by the Inc 0a baseline battery
   (deterministic fail, reproduced byte-identical on the tip-parent
   binary — the gate had never actually proven the cont lane). The
   full failure-cause taxonomy (stranding, aborts) remains Inc 2
   typed-outcome work.

## Recorded quirks (current behavior, not upstream-shaped)

- **Anthropic response IDs**: the serial lane mints one `chatcmpl-N` /
  `cmpl-N` job ID for every surface, and `anthropic_final_response` /
  the Anthropic stream use it directly — so Anthropic clients see
  `"id":"chatcmpl-N"` instead of an upstream-shaped `msg_*` ID.
  Responses is unaffected (`responses_final_response` and
  `responses_stream_init` mint their own `resp_*`/`rs_*`/`msg_*` IDs).
  Identity minting moves into the typed wire session in a later
  increment; until then this is frozen, documented behavior.

## Route observation metrics

`GET /metrics` exposes `ds4_route_requests_total{surface=...,lane=...}`
(fixed cardinality: 4 surfaces x 3 lanes, all cells always emitted);
`GET /v1/stats` mirrors it as the `routes` section. One increment per job
at the moment a lane takes it — a failed batched attempt that falls back
to serial increments both lanes. These counters are observation only;
they exist so route promotion can prove engagement (an eligible request
actually moved lanes) instead of inferring it.

## Fixture inventory (`ds4_test --server`)

Deterministic token/text tapes replayed through the CURRENT projectors,
validated by protocol event validators (event order, one open/close per
block/item, contiguous Responses `sequence_number`, UTF-8 hold-back):

- `test_tape_openai_chat_stream_projection` (thinking + UTF-8-split tapes)
- `test_tape_openai_completion_stream_projection` (the oracle for defect 1)
- `test_tape_anthropic_stream_projection`
- `test_tape_responses_stream_projection`
- `test_tape_buffered_final_responses` (all four buffered objects +
  finish mapping, including Anthropic `length -> max_tokens`)
- `test_cont_completion_stream_matches_serial_oracle` (the inverted
  Inc 0a negative fixture for defect 1 — cont and serial now share the
  legacy-Completion stream shape)
- `test_route_decisions_record_current_dispatch`
- `test_idempotency_key_header_is_ignored`
- `test_responses_durable_references_rejected_at_parse`
- `test_error_envelopes_native_shapes` (defect 3, now asserting the
  native shapes + the negative-budget parse rejections)

Existing per-feature streaming tests (`test_openai_tool_stream_*`,
`test_anthropic_tool_stream_*`, `test_responses_*`) cover tool-call
projection per surface and remain part of the oracle.

Live-sampled output is never a byte oracle: continuous temp-0 emissions
jitter run-to-run, so live end-to-end gates assert schema, event automata,
route engagement, and semantic equivalence — not byte identity.
